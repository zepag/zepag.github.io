<h1>ExtJS and me ;) </h1>In my search for good client application widgets, a few years ago, I started to look at YahooUI.<br />In these days (&#8220;days of yore&#8221; would be a tad inappropriate ;) ), YahooUI had some limitations, and only a few &#8220;out-of-the-box&#8221; widgets for &#8220;enterprise&#8221; applications.<br /><br />The following is an approximated history of ExtJS, don&#8217;t take it for granted&#8230; :p<br /><br />At some point, Jack Slocum forked or bundled, or rewrote a whole lot of YahooUI, known in these days as YahooUI-ext (extension).<br />This is when I learned about it, thanks to my soon-to-be boss (javascript hacker in his spare time ;)).<br />Though as the project evolved, and the codebase got almost completely rewritten, the project began to include YahooUI as one of its core mechanims (and therefore YahooUI-Ext was not only an extension to YahooUI anymore), which was the major shift that made the renamed ExtJS a framework in its own right. From now on, YahooUI dependency could be completely removed, and other frameworks could be used as an core mechanism (JQuery, Prototype&#8230;).<br /><br />At some point (version 2.0 and on) a specifically rewritten and optimized extjs mechanism was made available: ext-base. From there on, other frameworks were not even necessary anymore.<br /><br /><h1>Javascript thingy&#8230; why OMG why???</h1><br />In a few previous posts, I&#8217;ve already tried to debunk the javascript monster, in order to show that Javascript is a very good language, and that the monster in the browser is not javascript itself (though as every language, it&#8217;s far from perfect), but the DOM one has to deal with (which differs from browser to browser).<br /><br />As a web era guy, I&#8217;ve always felt deeply uncomfortable coding web interfaces with server-side languages (even if they are for rich-client-like applications). It has always made me feel like playing volley-ball knee-deep in liquid honey&#8230; (ok this is a weird image, though it conveys the message I guess).<br /><br />In fact, HTTP is a disconnected protocol, and I&#8217;ve always felt like one should use the best tool on both sides.<br />Before a few years ago and the dawning of AJAX, the client side was in a &#8220;ask-for-page, display-page, submit-form&#8221; paradigm which made server-side handling of web sites still relevant.<br />With AJAX and modern frameworks like ExtJS, it is possible to build your client application with a notepad in an html file, and then provide a backend based on any technology you see fit: JavaEE, .Net, PHP, CGI&#8230;<br />Moreover, if you need to change the UI or refresh it a bit later on, you will have the opportunity to do it without touching the logic-handling backend.<br /><br />I know for a fact that this ranting is directly (in my case) directed towards frameworks like JSF or GWT (the later being a specific case, as all it does is allowing you to code javascript + HTML + CSS in Java, and also because I think it&#8217;s a damn good framework).<br /><br />There are 2 tasks one has to handle with a javascript based framework like ExtJS (in fact 3, because the first is to know a bit more than average about Javascript) in order to achieve productivity:<br /><ol><li>Use an appropriate tooling: Javascript is not compiled, a validation tool is then required (and code completion is a nice-to-have)</li><li>Try to structure your code properly: This is (sadly) not very much documented.</li></ol><br />I&#8217;ll try to detail the second point in this post. For the first one, I&#8217;d recommend the use of Aptana, TextMate, or Spket in Eclipse. Visual Studio seems to have some Intellisense features for ExtJS. Learn more <a href="http://www.extjs.com/learn/Manual:Resources#IDEs">here</a>.<br /><br /><h1>The need to structure</h1>When you download ExtJS, you receive a whole lot of good stuff. Among these a lot of examples&#8230;<br /><br />What is hard to do is to try and begin an application.<br />Very quickly, you&#8217;ll end up creating a grid, and asking yourself: &#8220;My Ajax server-side request seems to be called and returns JSON/XML, then why is it that my grid doesn&#8217;t show the records?&#8221;.<br />You&#8217;ll soon see that extending the default <b>stores</b> and <b>readers</b> will allow you to whether use browsers&#8217; consoles (when they have one) or message boxes in order to give feedback on potential errors.<br />By default, the framework&#8217;s widgets are quite silent about this. <br /><br />Though all the hooks are in place, allowing you to add the expected behaviour (e.g. a popup when server-side errors occur, or even a retry policy, or displaying a loading icon&#8230;).<br /><br />In order to achieve and more importantly maintain that, a bit of structure is necessary.<br />This is what I&#8217;ll try and demonstrate in my next blog post.</div>
