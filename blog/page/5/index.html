DBA-Developer relationship, try to improve it&#8230; ok&#8230; too bad DBAs are not there to here that ;)<br /><br />Operational considerations:<br />- Data volumes, row sizes<br />- Growth estimates, update frequencies<br />- Availability requirements<br />- Testing/QA requirements<br /><br />Guidelines:<br />- appropriate data types<br />- small rows<br />- split large tables with one-to-one table containing fewer used fields<br />- improve indexes<br />- normalize data<br />- partition data (if available)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Most important: application tuning:</span><br />- keep transactions short<br />- bulk processes => off-hours<br />- understand locking (on writes, on reads&#8230;escalation of row locks to table locks in case of many reads&#8230;)<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">ORM tuning:</span><br />- watch Criteria, no NULLS in the WHERE clause, they are not indexed<br />- like with % at the beginning: no index either<br />- pick an appropriate TransactionManager (only use XA when accessing JMS and database together)<br />- use READONLY, try to avoid SERIALIZABLE<br />- use lazy-loading<br />- use caching<br /><br />JDBC Tuning:<br />- set the fetch size on connections (defaults to 10 for Oracle driver&#8230;) lessens the network roundtrips<br /><br />Hibernate Tuning:<br />- use &#8220;select&#8221; fetch mode for relationships needed sometimes - results in 1 or 2 queries.<br />- use &#8220;join&#8221; fetch mode for relationships needed all the time (try to limit to one per object)<br />- use &#8220;batch-size&#8221; to prefetch a number of proxies and/or collections<br /><br />Bulk operations:<br />- do it in the database to avoid network (SQL statement, stored procedure, native data load tools&#8230;)<br />- if you need to do it from the application: JdbcTemplate (batchUpdate), SimpleJdbcInsert (executeBatch), Spring Batch (BatchSqlUpdateItemWriter), Hibernate (set hibernate.jdbc.batch_size and flush and clear session after each batch)<br /><br />SQL Tuning:<br />- Capture SQL<br />- Run EXPLAIN<br />- adjust: analyse, tweak optimizer, add index<br />- repeat until adequate performance<br />- ASK for help from your DBA ;)<br /><br />OpenSource JDBC monitors:<br />- p6spy<br />- Elvyx<br />- JDBCSpy<br /><br />Database specific tools:<br />- MySQL (slow query log with &#8211;log-slow-queries or &#8211;log-queries-not-using-indexes)<br />- Oracle: Enterprise Manager, Statspack<br />- Oracle XA: Monitor Top SQL<br /><br />Interesting tips for Oracle:<br />- Use the call to a function setting the module name in Oracle in the validation query for the connection<br />- Use explain and autotrace in Oracle SQL Developer<br />- Use ANALYSE TABLE [table] COMPUTE STATISTICS<br />- Use ANALYSE INDEX [index] COMPUTE STATISTICS<br /><br />Database Tuning:<br />- Memory (Global Area SGA, Session Area PGA)<br />- Disk (Block size, File placement)<br /><br />Talks about a ProxyDatasource during Q&A.

9h30, Keynote should start any minute.<br /><br />First, the main local organizer of Spring One talks about his baby: Parleys. He shows off a very nice Flex-based UI. Flex is definitely nice, and what they&#8217;ve done with id also! Check for version 2 of Parleys very soon, it&#8217;s great!<br /><br />Rod Johnson:<br />A bit of commercial Blah&#8230; (sorry, but that&#8217;s it&#8230; :P) though the content is quite relevant.<br />This quickly turns into a (little bit) more technical talk.<br />It also contains interesting bits that I didn&#8217;t know of or have not yet tested:<br />- Use of qualifiers in Annotation and XML configuration<br />- support for Meta-Annotations (annotate annotations ;)) which allows to use your own meta-tagging for your component types and then annotate them with Spring Annotations , the org.springframework.stereotypes package also provides sensible defaults.<br />- Junit 4 support through specific runner (haven&#8217;t had the opportunity to test it yet, but will indeed do it very soon!)<br /><br />Spring Integration is mentionned there, and I think (see later in this post) that this may be very soon a very important Spring project&#8230;<br /><br />Enters Keith Donald who talks about the web tier.<br />Interesting Javascript module&#8230; worth following&#8230;<br /><br />Rod Johnson again:<br />Spring Powered applications: replaces more and more the JEE container.<br />Decoupling of business logic from deployment platform in terms of choice. (can be argued with their new server which relies a lot on Spring ;) ).<br />Obviously leads to Springsource Application Platform.<br /><br />Christian Dupuis:<br />Nice presentation of STS. Should have been preceded by a SpringSource AP in-depth presentation.<br /><br />Peter Cooper-Ellis, comes from BEA, and gives a little talk about his view of SpringSource and Spring.<br /><br />Rod Johnson:<br />Predictions => most interesting: app server and ESB fusion (see Spring integration merging with Spring AP ;), it seems so obvious)</div>

I was hoping for Ben Alex on Spring Security Two, but he&#8217;s not attending. I was a bit disappointed with a talk on Spring Security that barely scratched the surface.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
This strange thought occured to me yesterday:<br />It is quite disturbing to see how coding can be close to a psychiatric sickness.<br /><br />I was gently coding through a piece of code while being often disturbed by phone calls, meetings and other daily stuff.<br /><br />The obvious outcome was a messy code with an almost as much messy runtime result.<br /><br />At that precise moment, I was having a hard time focusing on this &#8220;algorithm&#8221; and the fact that the states in my java code could possibly be accessed from multiple threads was going to make things less easy.<br /><br />Therefore, with all that mess in my mind and my phone ringing now and then, I started commenting my code to make it readable (a bad habit indeed, as code should be self-readable by separating concerns in methods with readable names and sharing states in richly defined objects&#8230; but anyway&#8230;).<br /><br />When I was over commenting, the code did not behave any better, but was interweaved with rich textual descriptions.<br />Though it seemed that the added comments did not go further than the limitations I was already feeling (remember? difficulty to focus and phone ringing).<br />The comments themselves where sitting on top of the pile of messy code I had produced, with no added value as they were a direct transcription of how I was reasoning at that moment.<br /><br />So I decided to remove all these comments and to create a few rich immutable objects for states, and using ConcurrentHashMap and Atomic* all around.<br />My code was indeed completely thread-safe.<br /><br />But still&#8230; its behaviour was the same: not what I expected.<br /><br />So I decided to call in for help.<br /><br />I turned to one of my dear colleagues, and asked him to lend me a bit of his time in order to have a second look on my piece of code.<br />In fact, I couldn&#8217;t even think of a new way to look at it.<br /><br />Indeed, he gently accepted and sat next to me in order to look at my uncommented (if  he reads this, he&#8217;ll eventually remember telling me how messy and uncommented it looked ;) ) piece of over-immutable code.<br /><br />And then began an uncontrolled shrink scene.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s how this dialog (approximatively and &#8220;embellished&#8221; a bit) turned out:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">me:</span> &#8220;So here&#8217;s my code, here is what it does, and things are all immutable and stuff&#8230;&#8221;<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">colleague-shrink:</span> &#8220;Mmmmh mmh&#8230; So here&#8217;s your code, here is what it does, and things are all immutable and stuff?&#8221;<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">me:</span> &#8220;eh yes, look I&#8217;ve toggled breakpoints all around and I can&#8217;t seem to see anything wrong&#8221;<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">colleague-shrink:</span> &#8220;Mmmmh mmh&#8230; So You&#8217;ve toggled breakpoints all around and You can&#8217;t seem to see anything wrong?&#8221;<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">me:</span> &#8220;Oh no! this little thingy was there all the time&#8230;my algorithm was missing one point and I was looking for a synchronization issue. Well thank you for solving this issue with me!&#8221;<br /><br /><br />And then it occured to me that (even if my colleague would probably have solved this problem quite fast) the only presence of a real person to whom you explain your code acts like a catharsis for solving bugs.<br /><br />Though this is not very new and one of the basis of paired programming, the parallelism with the shrink made me a bit uneasy.<br /><br />Do I have to pay my colleague now, in order for the treatment to be efficient? ;)<br /><br />So I now decided that this would now be rewarded by beers. So if you happen (or happened) to be my code-shrink, don&#8217;t hesitate to reclaim your beverage!</div>

But go and get release 2.0 (released next week if I&#8217;m not wrong) it is amazingly productivity-inducing!<br /><br />And now on to Spring Batch.<br />This new product of the portfolio allows to deal with batching.<br />It was a project built by Accenture and is now a co-project of Accenture and Interface 21.<br /><br />It starts from the statement that nothing exists covering that subject in Java, and that there&#8217;s a common misconception about the fact that Batch is not possible nor efficient in java.<br /><br />It seems really complete and well-thought and is already production-grade.<br /><br />I really dig the Enterprise Message-driven processing, sadly it&#8217;s not targetted for version 1.0.<br /><br />Features:<br /><ul><br /><li>multiple formats for files</li><br /><li>Automatic retries</li><br /><li>Job control language (start, stop, suspend, cancel)</li><br /><li>status and statistics</li><br /><li>Entry points for launch (http, Unix script,incoming message, etc&#8230;)</li><br /><li>Ability to run concurrently with OLTP system</li><br /><li>Ability to use multiple transaction resources</li><br /><li>Support services (logging&#8230;etc)</li><br /></ul><br /><br />It really deals very well with batch retries at multiple levels, with a fairly rich set of possibilities.<br />Coding is (obviously one would say) POJO based, and batch behaviour is non-invasive.<br />Business logic is completely separated from job execution policies.<br /><br />The really interesting stuff not mentionned but implicit is that jobs can now be thoroughly unit tested (not integration tested, UNIT tested with mocks and everything!!).<br /><br />JMX Management is soon to be released. (How about batches launched from JRuby?)<br /><br />Roadmap:<br />Milestone 2 is soon to be released.<br />In the future:<br />Partitioned container,SEDA,Grid, ESB support, and more&#8230;</div>

Nice but does not fit with the current classloading designs where everything is in the same space (more or less)</li><br /><li><b>Operational control</b>: see modules and their status, install, activate,&#8230;bundles.</li><br /><li><b>Dealing with dynamics</b>: types and services can be exported and contributed (passive and active contribution respectively because services changes are dynamically seen).</li><br /></ul><br /><br />Then what about OSGI and Spring?<br />How do you split applications into a number of OSGI bundles<br />Bundles need: instanciation, configuration, assembly, decoration.<br />This should not be coded, this is (mostly) boiler-plate code.<br /><br />The purpose is to keep the Spring development model.<br /><br />Main entrypoint there is an OSGI bundle-based application context.<br /><br />Interesting thing is that beans can easily be exposed with a specific namespace (<b>&lt;osgi:service/&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;osgi:reference/&gt;</b>) and all the lifecycle and (re)binding of services is dealt with by Spring OSGI.<br /><br />The ConfigurableBundleCreatorTests are interesting for integration testing. It can run the test of your code inside of an OSGI container. This is really a great progress, mostly if one can set it up for testing Eclipse plugins&#8230;<br /><br />Provisioning with Maven and Ivy is also a catch and is planned for after version 1.0 (part of Maven support already is included in pre 1.0 though).</div>
