With this third part, we&#8217;re starting to dig into the interesting bits: modules or how to manage the scope of your code.<br /><b>EDIT: Modules are delayed to a further blog post :p</b><br /><br />But before this, let&#8217;s talk about something else as an appetizer.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:140%;">Boolean(false) is truthy</span><br /><br />Javascript shares the burden of C-Style truthy/falsy concept. These are non-boolean expressions that can be treated as a boolean value. It is both powerful and very dangerous, because (once again) it presumes the developer already knows everything about the language&#8217;s subtleties.<br /><br />So let&#8217;s first list the falsy elements, all the rest being truthy: <b>0</b>,<b>false</b> (of course), <b>empty string: &#8220;&#8221; or &#8221;</b>, <b>null</b><br /><br />Presented this way, it seems quite simple&#8230; though there are some quirks due to where and how you&#8217;re going to take advantage of these evaluations.<br />For example, 0 evaluates to false, while &#8216;0&#8217; evaluates to true (non-empty string). This sounds easy once again, but can be tricky when you receive a variable value and just test it this way: <i>if(myVar){&#8230;}</i>. It can lead to very counter-intuitive tests&#8230;<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="javascript">var myVar=new Boolean(false);<br />if(myVar){<br />    alert("true");<br />// Never use alert() in real applications, it blocks all javascript execution in all tabs of a browser until you close it.<br />}<br /></pre>This is one example of code where one should stop thinking in another language&#8217;s logic (Java or C# for example). <i>new Boolean(false)</i> is an object, and an object is always truthy, ending up with an alert popup showing &#8220;true&#8221;.<br />Though if you replace <i>if(myVar)&#8230;</i> with <i>if(myVar==true)&#8230;</i> the test will end up as expected, with nothing happening.<br />This can be confusing&#8230; I agree, and it did confuse me. Until I heard about the === operator. In javascript, == was designed as a tolerant operator, which accepts 1==&#8217;1&#8217; as a true assertion. So in later versions of javascript (when war between Netscape and IE was raging a while ago), a new === operator was introduced for a comparison of references. This operator is the one you&#8217;d want to use in order to be sure that an object is the same as another.<br /><br /><br />Oh and by the way, this may not be the last of my posts about javascript&#8230; so I&#8217;m going to drop in some of the references I used, in order not to forget them, and leave you my dear only reader with something else to read ;).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/javascript/TruthyFalsyAndTypeCasting">a Blog post about Truthy falsy</a><br /><a href="http://javascript.crockford.com">The source of all javascript wisdom ;): Sir Crockford.</a></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
First part of this &#8220;series&#8221; introduced basic concepts of the javascript language.<br />This new entry will introduce the functional nature of javascript.<br /><br /><br />In javascript, there is (almost) no limit to where a function can be defined (as opposed to a class language like java for example). It doesn&#8217;t even have to have a name and can be defined anonymously. A function can also be created as a local variable in another function&#8217;s body (inner function).<br /><br />Functions represent the real power of javascript. Not understanding them means not understanding javascript.<br /><br />Javascript uses functions all around. Functions are <b>objects</b>, and as such can be passed as parameters to other functions, or returned from other function&#8217;s invocation.<br /><br />As there is no proper class, one may think that there is no such thing as a method. This is not really the case. In fact one may call &#8220;method&#8221; any function defined as an attribute to an object.<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="javascript"><br />var myObj={<br />    myAttribute:"valueOfAttribute",<br />    myMethod: function(){<br />        if(console){<br />            console.log("hello universe");<br />        }<br />    }<br />};<br /></pre><br />Functions are (almost) always stored in a variable of some kind, and can even be stored in local variables. <br />In fact, defining a function in an html script tag like this:<br /><pre name="code" class="javascript"><br />function myFunction(){<br />    if(console){<br />        console.log("hello universe");<br />    }<br />}<br /></pre><br />&#8230; is completely equivalent to the following definition:<br /><pre name="code" class="javascript"><br />var myFunction=function(){<br />    if(console){<br />        console.log("hello universe");<br />    }<br />};</pre><br />This form is much clearer, as there is now no ambiguity about its object nature and about where it is stored&#8230; at least when you understand another little thing&#8230;<br /><br /><span style="font-size:140%;">The global object:</span><br /><b><br />In javascript, if you don&#8217;t use the var keyword, or if you define variables in no specific construct </b>(e.g. not in a function, an object, an array, or any conditional construct like if, for&#8230;etc), <b>variables are defined as attributes to the global object. The global object depends on the runtime you are coding for. In a browser, this global object is the <u>window</u> object.</b><br /><br />Now read my lips: <b>&#8220;GLOBAL OBJECT IS EVIL&#8221;</b>. This global space is the worst place for the definition of your code. Oh, and by the way, variables defined without the var keyword are <u>always</u> defined as attributes of this global object, regardless of their scope.<br /><br />So, what&#8217;s the solution to this?<br /><br />Create your own <b>namespace</b>! <br /><br />You&#8217;ll often ear about namespaces in the javascript world. In fact, this just refers to a container (javascript object) containing all the objects, states  and functions needed for your code. This allows you not to pollute the global namespace (though this is not sufficient to disallow access to private states, wait for 3rd part of this blog series on the module pattern).<br /><br />YahooUI started this trend with the YAHOO namespace. Other frameworks have also created their namespace(s) (Ext.* for ExtJS, dojo.* for Dojo, a global &#8220;$&#8221; or &#8220;jQuery&#8221; object for JQuery, Prototype.* for prototype, etc&#8230;). This allows the use of various &#8220;libraries&#8221; that are less likely to collide, or at least in a more controlled fashion.<br /><br />As demonstrated in previous blog entry, creating an object, and therefore a namespace, is very easy:<br /><pre name="code" class="javascript"><br />var MyNamespace={};<br /></pre><br />And now adding elements to this namespace is as easy as invoking<br /><pre name="code" class="javascript"><br />MyNamespace.myElement="element's value";<br />MyNamespace.myFunction=function(){<br />    if(console){<br />        console.log("hello universe");<br />    }<br />}<br /></pre><br />You can see that the function we mentionned before is now defined in a custom object (namespace) and that we can therefore invoke:<br /><pre name="code" class="javascript"><br />MyNamespace.myFunction();<br /></pre><br />This exemple is of course very simplistic, and not very secure. In fact any code can replace these states, because objects don&#8217;t have scopes! Let&#8217;s detail this mind-boggling fact.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:140%;">Objects don&#8217;t have scopes, functions do</span><br /><br />When you create an object, its state is public and accessible to any code that has access to the object in the first place. Any other code can add, remove and update entries from this container.<br /><br />The only mean of reducing scope in javascript is functions. Hence the functional nature of the language.<br /><br />Whatever is defined in a function is only accessible to this function and to any other construct defined in this function. <b>The only visible thing from a given function, is the result from its invocation.</b><br /><br /><pre name="code" class="javascript"><br />var myFunction=function(){<br />    var myVar="hello universe";<br />    // let's create an object accessing this 'private' state<br />    var result={<br />        myPublicVar:myVar+", I'm a public variable"<br />    };<br />    return result;<br />}<br />// next line will output undefined, because myVar is local to the function only.<br />console.log(myFunction.myVar);<br />// the next one will output 'hello universe, I'm a public variable', because the object returned by the invocation has access to the context of the function it was defined in (by the way, this is what is usually called access through a closure).<br />console.log(myFunction().myPublicVar);<br /></pre><br />As you may have noticed, and as a little conclusion to this post, one thing you really have to be careful with when reading or writing javascript code, is the presence of <b>()</b>. Whether a function is invoked or not is really important. This will determine whether you are left with the function object itself, ready to be invoked at will, or with the result from this function&#8217;s invocation. <br /><br />This is it for the moment. next entry will deal with the constructors (and the other ways to invoke a function), the concept of module, the truthy/falsy idea, and also give credit to the reference(s) used to build this little introduction to javascript ;).</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I&#8217;ve really wanted (and still want) to have a grasp on how Javascript should be coded <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Javascript way</span>.<br /><br />As a regular <span style="font-weight: bold;">Java</span> (and occasionally other languages) developer, I&#8217;ve sometimes used javascript with this constant sense of weirdness on the edges, and without being able to grasp the concepts in it.<br />In fact, the browsers&#8217; DOM and the history of the Javascript implementations in browsers contributed to this fuzziness (as we&#8217;ll see later).<br /><br /><span style="font-size:140%;">Basic concepts:</span><br /><br />Javascript has very little to do with Java. In fact its name only contains java for marketting purposes of that time. Javascript is a language from the C family like java and uses a lot of the same operators and syntax.<br /><br />This can be confusing, because Java and Javascript are indeed <span style="font-weight: bold;">very</span> different.<br /><br />While <span style="font-style:italic;">Java</span> is based on classes and inheritance <span style="font-style:italic;">between classes</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">Javascript</span> is based on objects and inheritance between <span style="font-weight:bold;">objects</span>.<br />Javascript is also a prototype-based language (which is I think the hardest part to grasp&#8230;).<br /><br />This may sound a bit abstract, but one cannot hope coding proper javascript without at least understanding these concepts.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:140%;">A little pause</span><br /><br />Before we start explaining the previous concepts, you must be aware that Javascript&#8217;s history has been very clumsy to say the least.<br />Some good decisions were taken, and some very bad ones.<br /><br />Most of the bad decisions were made during the browsers&#8217; war (Netscape vs Internet Explorer) with a purpose to attract developers from Java/C++ or VBScript for example.<br /><br />These bad decisions leave strange reserved words in the language (like &#8216;abstract&#8217; or &#8216;interface&#8217; which are never used,) that should never be used or even cannot be used, and constructs that come from other worlds.<br /><br />If you add to that the incompatibilities of APIs and models between browsers, it&#8217;s easy to understand why Javascript is still often considered as a toy language.<br /><br />So don&#8217;t be surprised by the number of things that should not be used or touched in Javascript.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:140%;">Javascript is not a toy language, nor a poor OO language.</span><br /><br />In fact, in a way, Javascript is more OO than Java is ;).<br />In Javascript (almost) everything is object (think instances, forget about classes!).<br /><br />Here&#8217;s a list of the things that are NOT objects in Javascript:<br /><ul><br /><li>numbers</li><br /><li>strings</li><br /><li>booleans</li><br /><li>null</li><br /><li>undefined</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Everything else is objects.</span><br />Yes, everything.<br />Keep that in mind, and remember (again) that I said Object (instance), not Class.<br /><br />One really clever thing that was done in javascript is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">merging of Objects and Hashtable</span>.<br />A new Object is an empty container of key/value pairs.<br /><br />For example, one can create an object using:<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="javascript"><br />var myObject={};<br /></pre><br /><br />As Javascript is loosely typed, there is no class definition. You just created an Object with nothing in it.<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="javascript"><br />var user={<br />    firstname="Pierre-Antoine"<br />    ,'lastname'='Grégoire'<br />    ,age=31<br />};<br /></pre><br /><br />As you can see, it&#8217;s quite easy to create an object using key/values.<br />As you also probably noticed, keys can be String, therefore allowing access to members in two ways:<br /><ul><br /><li>using the dot notation: <span style="font-style: italic;">user.firstName</span> </li><br /><li>using the subscript notation: <span style="font-style: italic;">user[&#8220;firstname&#8221;]</span></li><br /></ul><br /><br />This is it for this first short part. Next blog entry will introduce the functional nature of Javascript.</div>

Read the interesting (IM<span style="font-weight:bold;">N</span>SHO) bits below.<br /><br />Spring Web Services is Contract-First.<br /><br />Tools for contract infering from an xml instance:<br />Trang, XMLSpy, Microsoft XML to Schema (and an additional: Oxygen XML does that if I remember well). Why isn&#8217;t there a java library for that (for use in IDEs and scripts)?<br /><br />(Of course) contract first is really a good practice, and schemas (once you get to know them) are really a very expressive language for message content description.<br /><br />New in Spring Web Services 1.5: <br />- JMS and Mail transports (a bit of overlap with Spring Integration&#8230; though this may merge sooner or later).<br />- WSS4J support (including client-side)<br />- WS-Addressing support<br />- OSGI Bundles</div>

This illustrates (and answers) a question I&#8217;ve always asked myself: Why shouldn&#8217;t we code batch jobs in java&#8230;? In fact It&#8217;s a lot more portable, testable and encapsulate-able than most of the usually used languages/platform nowadays.<br /><br />Spring Batch 2.0 will be Java 5 ready.<br /><br />Really interesting talk, yet already partly seen last year, and&#8230;I passed out a bit.<br /><br />It seems that there is an underlying convergence between Spring Batch and Spring Integration (after all Batches are only integration operations that are longer or operate on larger sets of data, with a bit more requirements in the failure handling&#8230;)</div>

This presentation talks about 2.5 and the future (3.0).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">2.5 summary:</span><br />- 2.0 kernel so-to-say plus additional features.<br />- end of 1.3 support (who cares? ;););) )<br />- JDK 1.6 support: JDBC 4.0, JMX MXBeans (supports runtime snapshots)<br />- AspectJ load-time weaving (available in 2.0 but not mainstream as in 2.5) through a platform support or a generic Spring VM agent using &lt;context:load-time-weaver /&gt;<br />- JEE 5.0 support (JPA support is improved, EclipseLink support) and all other JEE 5.0 APIs<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">A bit of details on 2.5:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">JSR 250 Common Annotations:</span><br />Good: @PostConstruct, @PreDestroy<br />Bad: @Resource ;);) of course, this annotation is a bit limited (injects a resource from JNDI from a name in a setter or field)&#8230; yet a standard. Life is a bitch&#8230; though Spring allows using it without JNDI :).<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Other annotations:</span><br />- @WebServiceRef/@EJB (should have been named @EJBRef&#8230; life is really a bitch)<br />- @TransactionAttribute (EJB 3 transaction demarcation&#8230; a bit limited)<br />- @PersistenceContext / @PersistenceUnit already supported in 2.0: JPA resource injection<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">@Autowired Spring annotation</span><br />- on fields, configuration methods, constructors<br />- nice sweet-spot between autowiring by type and autowiring by name: annotation-driven, less wild-guessing.<br />- @Qualifier allows to narrow the potential autowired components if multiple are available. This is also available in the xml syntax in beans. Qualifier can be a bean name or an annotation applied to a bean.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">@Configurable with AspectJ</span><br />- classes can be weaved and may be created by using a simple &#8220;new&#8221; constructor call!<br />- using &lt;context:load-time-weaver aspectj-weaving=&#8221;on&#8221;/&gt; and &lt;context:spring-configured /&gt; (and of course the appropriate class-loader/agent).<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">@Transactional with AspectJ</span><br />- using &lt;context:load-time-weaver aspectj-weaving=&#8221;on&#8221;/&gt; and &lt;tx:annotation-driven mode=&#8221;aspectj&#8221; transaction-manager=&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;<br />- avoids creation of proxies by using load-time weaving.<br />- also works for private and protected methods, and for code from same component (common problem with proxies).<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Annotated MVC:</span><br />- @Controller, @RequestMapping&#8230;etc (I already tested it, you should try it ;) )<br />- allows POJO Controllers for classic methods, or in portlets&#8230;<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Test Context Framework:</span><br />- @ContextConfiguration, @TransactionConfiguration<br />- works with JUnit 4.4 (@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)) and TestNG<br />- no use of class hierarchies&#8230; nice and light ;) (a bit troubling though as the test almost contains anything except metadata&#8230;.)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Recommandations:</span><br />- Option 1: XML-based configuration complemented with annotations.<br />- Option 2: more radical: Fully annotated components. (Not that much an XML hater&#8230; so it seems a bit over-strict)&#8230;<br />- Externalized configuration => XML<br />- Embedded configuration => Annotations<br />- Find the balance, and mix and match!!!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Spring 3.0 insights:</span><br />- Spring 2.5.5,2.5.6 up until July (OSGI refinements)<br />- Spring 3.0 RC1 (August)<br />- Spring 3.0 GA in Q4: Java 5 in the core (internal use of Generics and varargs), support of Portlet 2.0, preparation of Servlet 3.0,  => REST support, EL support, conversational support&#8230;<br />- Backwards compatibility with removal of deprecated APIs.<br />Pruning and Deprecation:<br />-prune: Commons Attributes<br />-prune: Toplink (EclipseLink)<br />-deprecated: pre JDK 5.0 support</div>

Not Ben Alex, but let&#8217;s not judge the speaker so fast ;)<br /><br />Interesting demo showing a completely unsecured Spring-based (of course) application completely secured on the fly using Acegi&#8230;uh sorry Spring Security (I actually got used to Acegi ;)). Quite classical, but enhances the improvements in the configuration.<br /><br />A few interesting things to know:<br />- new Spring 2.x namespace for lighter configuration.<br />- Only one filter: DelegatingFilterProxy with a filter chain behind.<br />- REST Support: you can specify the method (POST, PUT, DELETE&#8230;) in the intercept-url element.<br />- very nice ldap-user-service configuration&#8230; worth checking!!!<br />- Embedded Apache DS: very nice!<br />- easy to mix and match multiple schemes: OpenId for authentication, and JDBC for user details or NTML for Authentication and Active Directory for User details.<br /><br />He mentions an interesting possibility: only testing the securisation of methods by completely removing the call to the underlying method. Sadly he doesn&#8217;t go into details.<br /><br />A nice practice also: securing based on permissions and not on roles. This is much better for further evolutions. Roles change, permissions less likely.<br /><br />In the end (I knew a bit from the tests I did recently) Spring Security is an improvement in terms of useability, (if not in features, it keeps the plethora of features of the original), on Acegi.</div>
