This strange thought occured to me yesterday:<br />It is quite disturbing to see how coding can be close to a psychiatric sickness.<br /><br />I was gently coding through a piece of code while being often disturbed by phone calls, meetings and other daily stuff.<br /><br />The obvious outcome was a messy code with an almost as much messy runtime result.<br /><br />At that precise moment, I was having a hard time focusing on this &#8220;algorithm&#8221; and the fact that the states in my java code could possibly be accessed from multiple threads was going to make things less easy.<br /><br />Therefore, with all that mess in my mind and my phone ringing now and then, I started commenting my code to make it readable (a bad habit indeed, as code should be self-readable by separating concerns in methods with readable names and sharing states in richly defined objects&#8230; but anyway&#8230;).<br /><br />When I was over commenting, the code did not behave any better, but was interweaved with rich textual descriptions.<br />Though it seemed that the added comments did not go further than the limitations I was already feeling (remember? difficulty to focus and phone ringing).<br />The comments themselves where sitting on top of the pile of messy code I had produced, with no added value as they were a direct transcription of how I was reasoning at that moment.<br /><br />So I decided to remove all these comments and to create a few rich immutable objects for states, and using ConcurrentHashMap and Atomic* all around.<br />My code was indeed completely thread-safe.<br /><br />But still&#8230; its behaviour was the same: not what I expected.<br /><br />So I decided to call in for help.<br /><br />I turned to one of my dear colleagues, and asked him to lend me a bit of his time in order to have a second look on my piece of code.<br />In fact, I couldn&#8217;t even think of a new way to look at it.<br /><br />Indeed, he gently accepted and sat next to me in order to look at my uncommented (if  he reads this, he&#8217;ll eventually remember telling me how messy and uncommented it looked ;) ) piece of over-immutable code.<br /><br />And then began an uncontrolled shrink scene.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s how this dialog (approximatively and &#8220;embellished&#8221; a bit) turned out:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">me:</span> &#8220;So here&#8217;s my code, here is what it does, and things are all immutable and stuff&#8230;&#8221;<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">colleague-shrink:</span> &#8220;Mmmmh mmh&#8230; So here&#8217;s your code, here is what it does, and things are all immutable and stuff?&#8221;<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">me:</span> &#8220;eh yes, look I&#8217;ve toggled breakpoints all around and I can&#8217;t seem to see anything wrong&#8221;<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">colleague-shrink:</span> &#8220;Mmmmh mmh&#8230; So You&#8217;ve toggled breakpoints all around and You can&#8217;t seem to see anything wrong?&#8221;<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">me:</span> &#8220;Oh no! this little thingy was there all the time&#8230;my algorithm was missing one point and I was looking for a synchronization issue. Well thank you for solving this issue with me!&#8221;<br /><br /><br />And then it occured to me that (even if my colleague would probably have solved this problem quite fast) the only presence of a real person to whom you explain your code acts like a catharsis for solving bugs.<br /><br />Though this is not very new and one of the basis of paired programming, the parallelism with the shrink made me a bit uneasy.<br /><br />Do I have to pay my colleague now, in order for the treatment to be efficient? ;)<br /><br />So I now decided that this would now be rewarded by beers. So if you happen (or happened) to be my code-shrink, don&#8217;t hesitate to reclaim your beverage!</div>
