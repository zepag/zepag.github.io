  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about relaunching my blog for a while, though I&rsquo;d have liked to be able to just write markdown and commit to publish, in order for it to really be a &ldquo;web log&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This is what I&rsquo;m starting now with the use of Octopress, an extension of Jekyll which allows me to publish to github pages. e.g. to create a file, commit and that&rsquo;s basically it.</p>

<p>Practically it&rsquo;s still not exactly what I want because it requires Jekyll and therefore Ruby. Though I think that part should be easy to automate somehow.
Next step I guess ;).</p>

<p>For the sake of it, I also imported my (very) old blogger posts, using the script found here:

OSGi bashing seems to be a widely appreciated sport these days.<br />The worrying part is where it comes from.<br /><br />As a disclaimer, I&#8217;d like to state that I quite love OSGi, because it provides <a href="http://osgithoughts.blogspot.com/2011/05/java-se-8-modularity-requirements.html">dynamic modularity, lifecycle and many other things Java SE is lacking</a>, and something the upcoming Java SE 8 modularity is not likely to provide. Besides that, it&#8217;s available now and has been for a while!<br /><br />This being said, OSGi is currently widely-used (at least this is where I see it used, not an exhaustive report):<br /><ul><li>in the embedded world (where it comes from)</li><li>in Software vendors products</li><li>in the core of IDEs or tools (mostly Eclipse of course) and application servers</li><li>Eclipse RCP rich clients</li></ul><br />OSGi coming from the embedded world, the enterprise software scope has only been very recently integrated. <br />Even though tooling is getting better with time (<a href="http://www.aqute.biz/Bnd/Bnd">Bnd</a>, <a href="http://www.springsource.org/bundlor">Bundlor</a>, <a href="http://ops4j1.jira.com/wiki/display/paxrunner/Pax+Runner">Pax</a> and many more&#8230;), frameworks are easing development a lot (<a href="http://www.springsource.org/osgi">Spring dM</a>, <a href="http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-ipojo.html">iPOJO</a>&#8230;etc), and many companies are providing quality solutions and investing in it, OSGi doesn&#8217;t seem to gain a lot of interest in mainstream development. Let me rephrase this explicitly: OSGi doesn&#8217;t seem to gain the interest it really diserves.<br /><br />The main problem is context. When development is shifting towards more deployment flexibility, the <b>rigor</b> of OSGi in this domain is both a <b>bliss</b> and a <b>curse</b>.<br /><ul><li>a bliss as it makes things really manageable at any scale.</li><li>a curse because of the difficulty for newcomers to easily integrate the dependency mechanisms and more important the difficulty to grasp/solve dependency issues.</li><br /></ul><br />This last point is quite important, as it is what has made people rant about Maven (and this still goes on) since its inception.<br /><br />Easing dependency management is already difficult statically, so doing it dynamically is even harder. OSGi is REALLY doing a great job in this domain.<br /><br />The main issue is that average enterprise developers, not the very clever ones hired e.g. by Oracle for the Glassfish team or by Spring for Eclipse Virgo (shameless plug there, I know or have met with people from these teams ;) ), don&#8217;t want to deal with dynamic dependencies. Just as they don&#8217;t want to deal with multicore development. Average enterprise developers want this to be hidden from them. This can be seen in each and every specification of JavaEE which seems recently to focus mostly on ease of development, sometimes leaving out ease of operations and flexibility. Enterprise developers don&#8217;t want to know about multithreading or dynamic modularity. <br /><br />Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I think it&#8217;s a shame. And once again I think OSGi is one of the best solutions for dynamic modularity.<br /><br />Still when companies which embraced OSGi and invested a lot in it back out, things don&#8217;t look very good.Mulesoft&#8217;s founder Ross Mason <a href="http://blogs.mulesoft.org/osgi-no-thanks/">started</a> this a while ago after being disappointed by OSGi as a component model for Mule ESB. The Glassfish team embraced it, but only by hiding it behind the custom <a href="http://java.net/projects/hk2/content">HK2</a> core model. The JBoss Team has implemented an <a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossOSGi">abstraction</a> above its microcontainer allowing to use OSGi, once again hiding it behind a custom layer.In the enterprise world, the only major actor (I mean no insult to the very brilliant smaller companies which provide quality OSGi enterprise solutions) embracing the OSGi model directly is (was?) SpringSource/VMWare.<br /><br />What came as a surprise is Rod Johnson&#8217;s recent <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/2240037102/OSGi-Not-Easy-Enough-to-Use-Not-as-Productive-as-it-Should-Be">words</a> on that. Rob Harrop also backed this. Their seem to conclude that OSGi is hard to be made productive.Stated like this it&#8217;s not really fair.There is little doubt OSGi is lacking many productivity boosters now found in modern frameworks: Convention over Configuration, Annotation based development helpers, Aspects, Transactions handling &#8230;etcNevertheless I know for a fact that there are <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/virgo/">good</a> <a href="http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-ipojo.html">solutions</a> <a href="http://www.paremus.com/products/products.html">in the</a> <a href="http://karaf.apache.org/">OSGi world</a>. In fact, I think that if one compares OSGi to other dynamic modularity mechanisms, it is quite productive. It should not be compared directly to component models that leave out this dynamicity.<br /><br />The problem I see is that the OSGi world seems to be stuck in an oldish development model that fits well enough the embedded world it comes from (where the aforementioned development boosters are not really key features). Hence my recent comment on OSGi being stuck in the smart card age, which I should have rephrased as &#8220;OSGi is still held back by its embedded focus&#8221;.<br /><br />OSGi specifications should now enforce development boosters and not provide them as optional choices.<ul><li>It should be possible to create an OSGi bundle without a Manifest.mf file.</li><li>It should be possible to create an OSGi service providers/consumers just by adding an annotation to a class.</li><li>It should be possible to handle transactions easily.</li><li>It should be easy to operate bundles replacement.</li></ul>Well be glad, all of this is possible. Then be sad, as major vendors seem to turn their back on it.<br /><br />Two things in the end are really missing.<br />One thing really missing is an official repository (Ã  la Maven Central) for OSGi bundles, provided by the OSGi alliance. Because adapting some existing libraries as bundles is really hard and requires a very good knowledge of the inner mechanisms of OSGi. What Springsource provides could be a good template for this.<br />The other thing missing is incentive for existing libraries/frameworks to provide OSGi compatible versions of their components. With companies like SpringSource sending mixed messages, it will become difficult to fuel this&#8230; Though one can&#8217;t blame them for thinking that nodejs, rails, grails and such bring a breeze of fresh air to a regular OSGi developer ;)</div>

After using OSGi for a few years now and also having experience in J2EE and Spring I can see why people get scared. OSGi is great for modularity but is severely lacking the tooling that enterprise developers use daily that makes their lives/jobs easier and less frustrating.<br /><br />I have used OSGi in cases where hot deploying a jar file is extremely useful. This is especially true in cases where the internet feed to your production machine has very little bandwidth.<br /><br /></div>

Great Blog, I found this information very useful when researching OSGi.  Currently the thought of refactoring a large J2EE EAR / Spring DI / Hibernate / JPA project into OSGi bundles scares me to death as I have no idea where to begin.  I feel you have made good points about current vendors tools as well.</div>

Perhaps you mistyped something. Did you mean &quot;withOUT a modularised approach you&#39;ll have a hard time tracking what&#39;s actually running in your server (what modules, at what versions, and has this combinations been through QA?&#8230;)&quot;?<br /><br />Because I honestly cannot imagine how a non-modular approach &#8211; i.e. omitting all information about dependencies between modules, versions of those dependencies, versions of the modules themselves &#8211; could possibly HELP with any of the concerns you listed.</div>

Conceptually, modularity is awesome. Developing with services that have well defined lifecycles, segregated classloaders, interfaces and version numbers sounds like a good idea.<br /><br />In practice though, unless you&#39;re developing plug-in driven type of applications (like Eclipse), people seldom need such modularity. Applications are assembled, versioned and then deployed. No-one thinks of hot replacing a JAR at runtime as the best approach to fixing production: push-button deployment of an application as a whole gives excellent result and more predictability.<br /><br />Indeed, with a modularized approach you&#39;ll have hard time tracking what&#39;s actually running in your server (what modules, at what versions, and has this combination been through QA?&#8230;).<br /><br />For most the apps out there, OSGi modularity seems that it gives you the wrong seam for your architecture. Using messaging provides a better way of decoupling modules with semantics that cleanly support time decoupling. Actors provide a better decoupling for concurrency.<br /><br />My 2c.<br />D.</div>

This day (up until now) was dedicated to Hands-on.<br /><br />I (sadly) arrived a bit late this morning, for what was in fact (not) a &#8220;hands-on&#8221;.<br />It was a presentation of interesting tools: HDFS/Hadoop, and 2 alternative interaction points with Hadoop/HDFS: Hive (SQL92-like implementation) and Pig (scripted approach)<br /><br />If you want to have a look at a Map/Reduce implementation with a SQL background, then definitely have a look at Hive!<br />Otherwise, Pig seems more powerful and should appeal to python-lovers.<br /><br />In the afternoon, I went for Spring Roo and Spring STS presentations/hands-on.<br />This freshened up a bit my perception of these tools, as I may have to use a lot their most recent versions in the coming times.<br /><br />Finally, I had a glance at a presentation about Code/API documentation. 2 pointers there: Bumblebee and JCite.<br /><br />I&#8217;m now going to participate to Groovy/Grails and Spring BOFs.<br /><br />More feedback to come later on.<br /><br />(This weBLOG is meant to be read by his author only, If you happen to read it, please flash your memory and fall into sleep mode ASAP)</div>

<h1>ExtJS and me ;) </h1>In my search for good client application widgets, a few years ago, I started to look at YahooUI.<br />In these days (&#8220;days of yore&#8221; would be a tad inappropriate ;) ), YahooUI had some limitations, and only a few &#8220;out-of-the-box&#8221; widgets for &#8220;enterprise&#8221; applications.<br /><br />The following is an approximated history of ExtJS, don&#8217;t take it for granted&#8230; :p<br /><br />At some point, Jack Slocum forked or bundled, or rewrote a whole lot of YahooUI, known in these days as YahooUI-ext (extension).<br />This is when I learned about it, thanks to my soon-to-be boss (javascript hacker in his spare time ;)).<br />Though as the project evolved, and the codebase got almost completely rewritten, the project began to include YahooUI as one of its core mechanims (and therefore YahooUI-Ext was not only an extension to YahooUI anymore), which was the major shift that made the renamed ExtJS a framework in its own right. From now on, YahooUI dependency could be completely removed, and other frameworks could be used as an core mechanism (JQuery, Prototype&#8230;).<br /><br />At some point (version 2.0 and on) a specifically rewritten and optimized extjs mechanism was made available: ext-base. From there on, other frameworks were not even necessary anymore.<br /><br /><h1>Javascript thingy&#8230; why OMG why???</h1><br />In a few previous posts, I&#8217;ve already tried to debunk the javascript monster, in order to show that Javascript is a very good language, and that the monster in the browser is not javascript itself (though as every language, it&#8217;s far from perfect), but the DOM one has to deal with (which differs from browser to browser).<br /><br />As a web era guy, I&#8217;ve always felt deeply uncomfortable coding web interfaces with server-side languages (even if they are for rich-client-like applications). It has always made me feel like playing volley-ball knee-deep in liquid honey&#8230; (ok this is a weird image, though it conveys the message I guess).<br /><br />In fact, HTTP is a disconnected protocol, and I&#8217;ve always felt like one should use the best tool on both sides.<br />Before a few years ago and the dawning of AJAX, the client side was in a &#8220;ask-for-page, display-page, submit-form&#8221; paradigm which made server-side handling of web sites still relevant.<br />With AJAX and modern frameworks like ExtJS, it is possible to build your client application with a notepad in an html file, and then provide a backend based on any technology you see fit: JavaEE, .Net, PHP, CGI&#8230;<br />Moreover, if you need to change the UI or refresh it a bit later on, you will have the opportunity to do it without touching the logic-handling backend.<br /><br />I know for a fact that this ranting is directly (in my case) directed towards frameworks like JSF or GWT (the later being a specific case, as all it does is allowing you to code javascript + HTML + CSS in Java, and also because I think it&#8217;s a damn good framework).<br /><br />There are 2 tasks one has to handle with a javascript based framework like ExtJS (in fact 3, because the first is to know a bit more than average about Javascript) in order to achieve productivity:<br /><ol><li>Use an appropriate tooling: Javascript is not compiled, a validation tool is then required (and code completion is a nice-to-have)</li><li>Try to structure your code properly: This is (sadly) not very much documented.</li></ol><br />I&#8217;ll try to detail the second point in this post. For the first one, I&#8217;d recommend the use of Aptana, TextMate, or Spket in Eclipse. Visual Studio seems to have some Intellisense features for ExtJS. Learn more <a href="http://www.extjs.com/learn/Manual:Resources#IDEs">here</a>.<br /><br /><h1>The need to structure</h1>When you download ExtJS, you receive a whole lot of good stuff. Among these a lot of examples&#8230;<br /><br />What is hard to do is to try and begin an application.<br />Very quickly, you&#8217;ll end up creating a grid, and asking yourself: &#8220;My Ajax server-side request seems to be called and returns JSON/XML, then why is it that my grid doesn&#8217;t show the records?&#8221;.<br />You&#8217;ll soon see that extending the default <b>stores</b> and <b>readers</b> will allow you to whether use browsers&#8217; consoles (when they have one) or message boxes in order to give feedback on potential errors.<br />By default, the framework&#8217;s widgets are quite silent about this. <br /><br />Though all the hooks are in place, allowing you to add the expected behaviour (e.g. a popup when server-side errors occur, or even a retry policy, or displaying a loading icon&#8230;).<br /><br />In order to achieve and more importantly maintain that, a bit of structure is necessary.<br />This is what I&#8217;ll try and demonstrate in my next blog post.</div>

<h4>Out of Band (OOB) Channels</h4><br /> Visual channel (barcodes)<br /> Audio channel (key encoded by audio)<br /> Manual string comparison (comparing codes)<br /> Accelerometer data (devices shaken together)<br /> Button presses (buttons pressed at the same time)<br /><br /><h4>J2ME Polish</h4><br /> Nice tool to specify the target of the build<br /><br /><h4>ScreenSnap</h4><br /> In-device capture application for Java ME<br /><br />This Open UAT system would be interesting on Google Android for example&#8230;</div>

Starting with the JavaOne video<br />J.Gosling is then talking about network orientation, and the fact that Java is more about the JVM(s) than the language.<br /><br />He then demonstrates Glassfish v3 (finally, EJBs in webapps&#8230;) and Netbeans v6.7 which looks honestly pretty slick&#8230;<br /><br />Then talks about Real time JVM, and Intelligent Meshes (Sunspot (Squawk) VM, Sentilla.com).<br /><br />Talking about Hybrid car of Neil Young ;). May I suggest the guy is a little cocky there? ;);)<br /><br />Performance in java<br />Actually better than C/C++ in most cases.<br />He then demonstrates the now common assertion that Moore&#8217;s law is now wrong if you don&#8217;t consider the number of cores (not if one takes them into account).<br /><br />Funny point on the fact that most of what is happening on scientific calculation is driven by the progress of video games.<br /><br />A bit of advertizing on JDK 7 talk the following day.<br /><br />Java 6 updates (from 10 on)<br /> Fixes Desktop integration<br /> G1(Garbage first) collector<br /> Compressed pointers 32G==4G<br /><br />Web as the face of the Enterprise<br />=> JavaFX: same result as Flash, yet easier&#8230; still not convinced by that&#8230; :p</div>
